# Probabilistic modelling of protein sub-cellular localisation

### Abstract

In biology, localisation is function - understanding the sub-cellular
localisation of proteins is paramount to comprehend the context of
their functions. Mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics and
contemporary machine learning enable to build proteome-wide spatial
maps, informing us on the location of thousands of
proteins. Nevertheless, while some proteins can be found in a single
location within a cell, up to half of proteins may reside in multiple
locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown
functional compartment, leading to considerable uncertainty in
associating a protein to their sub-cellular location. Recent advances
enable us to probabilistically model protein localisation as well as
quantify the uncertainty in the location assignments, thus leading to
better and more trustworthy biological interpretation of the data.
